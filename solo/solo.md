# Chef-Solo minimal example

  up and running with chef-solo can be easy  peasy

* install che-client
* set up  a  config. In this case solo.rb for chef-solo
* pull down your recipe ( however you want. for my example I git cloned a repo with no dependencies)
* define your attrubutes
* and away we go
